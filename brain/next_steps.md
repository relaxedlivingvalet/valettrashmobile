# Next Steps

## Before Submitting to Stores (action required from you)

- [x] **Final app icon** — RLV logo installed at `mobile/assets/icon/`; launcher icons + splash regenerated (May 2026)
- [ ] **iOS signing** — requires macOS + Xcode + Apple Developer account ($99/yr):
  1. Open `ios/Runner.xcworkspace` in Xcode
  2. Set your Apple team under Signing & Capabilities
  3. `flutter build ipa` to produce the `.ipa` for App Store Connect
- [ ] **Android release build** — keystore already configured, run from a machine with Android SDK:
  ```
  flutter build appbundle
  ```
  Upload the `.aab` to Google Play Console
- [ ] **Production Supabase config** — when deploying to a real domain:
  - Update Site URL from `http://localhost:8091` to `https://yourdomain.com`
  - Add `https://yourdomain.com` to Redirect URLs
  - Enable a real email provider (Resend / SendGrid) for confirmation and reset emails
- [ ] **App Store / Play Store listing** — screenshots (6.7" iPhone, 12.9" iPad for iOS; multiple densities for Android), app description, keywords, age rating, privacy policy URL

## Next Features (prioritized)

- [ ] **Stripe paid comeback requests** — comeback card is now on resident Home tab; `ResidentComebackRequestScreen` already handles free/paid branching. Blocked on Stripe account + webhook secret. Once you have those, wire `stripe_checkout` into the paid path of `ResidentComebackRequestScreen`
- [ ] **Push notifications** — defer until native build is in TestFlight / Play Store internal testing:
  - Android: FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging) — free
  - iOS: APNs via FCM or OneSignal — requires Apple Developer account
- [ ] **Worker location on native** — currently uses `dart:html` (web only). Swap to `geolocator` package for iOS/Android builds
- [ ] **CSV export on native** — `PmComplianceReportScreen` uses `dart:html` for download. Swap to `path_provider` + `share_plus` for native builds

---

## Technical Debt

- [ ] `supabase_flutter` v1 → v2 upgrade — **BLOCKED** in this environment (missing transitive deps). Try on a machine with full internet/VPN access
- [ ] `main_simple.dart` — unclear purpose, remove or document
- [ ] Integration tests for invite code flow
- [ ] Confirm `AdminDashboardScreen` RLS policies cover all edge cases with real data at scale
